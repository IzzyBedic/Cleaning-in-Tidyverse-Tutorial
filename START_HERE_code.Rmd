## Introduction

Hello and welcome! In this Presentation, I will be going through some different
ways of cleaning this data set that I got off of Kaggle, called 
Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes_20231106.csv. 

I chose to clean this data set for my project because it makes me think about 
how data gets collected and how I would collect the data differently for my own 
research.

Overall, I think that the ability to clean data is an important skill that
involved many different types of data. 

## A Brief Reminder

Do NOT edit the original data set, create a data frame to work with and edit 
that. If you edit the original data set, you could mess with the data in a way
that creates inaccurate representation of the truth when you try to use the data
to visualize or analyze a phenomenon or relationship.

If you would like to save your edited data into a new csv or other type of file,
please rename it something other than the original file name and put it in an 
appropriate location with an appropriate name. This way you do not overwrite
your original data and you set yourself up for success in the way you have 
organized your project.

## Getting Your Data Into R

Download/export the csv file from the website linked in the wiki and put it into
a folder named csv. Make sure that your RMarkdown file is saved in a folder 
next to it, preferably with both in a folder named "Austin Data Tutorial" or
something similar. The .. raises you out of the folder your R Markdown folder is
in, and the /csv takes you to the csv folder next to it that contains the .csv 
file.

Please note that this is a continuously updated data set. 

If you would like your results to match mine exactly, you must get rid of all 
values from before 11/06/2023. We will be able to do this once we convert 
DateTime from a character into a date.

```{r dataframe}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "../")
austin_intake_raw <- read.csv("../csv/Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes_20231106.csv")
head(austin_intake_raw)

austin_intake <- austin_intake_raw
```

## Cleaning Messy Dates with Lubridate

I am mutating to create new rows instead of overwriting the old row because I 
want to be able to keep all the tidy and untidy data where I can see them until 
the very end, so that I can visually compare them next to each other to ensure 
that I am not doing anything weird to the data when I clean it. This is just
my personal preference.

```{r dates}
lubridated_alldates <- austin_intake %>% 
  mutate(datetime = mdy_hms(DateTime),
         date = date(datetime),
         hour = hour(datetime),
         month = month(datetime),
         day = day(datetime),
         year = year(datetime))

austin_intake %>% 
  select(MonthYear, DateTime) %>% 
  group_by(MonthYear, DateTime) 


lubridated_alldates %>% 
  select(date, MonthYear, month, year) %>% 
  group_by(MonthYear, year) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  arrange(date)
```

## Using the Lubridated Data to Make Your Data Match Mine

Here we make sure that any date before November 7th, 2023 is included. This 
ensures that your results will be the same as mine when you run the R script,
even if the data set that you download is from a date past November 6th, 2023.

```{r samedateasoriginal}
lubridated <- lubridated_alldates %>% 
  filter(date < "2023-11-07")
```

## Making a csv file with cleaned data

 The following was working fine as code, but had trouble when knitting. So,
 back-tick three times before {r csv} and after ") if you want to run it. 
`{r csv}
 write.csv(lubridated, "../csv/lubridated.csv")`
