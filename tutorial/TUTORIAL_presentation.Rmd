## Introduction

This is a tutorial!

- We'll start on Kaggle to get Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes_20231106.csv
- We'll clean the data as best we can
- We'll show the difference by making some figures that might not have been possible to make before cleaning

<div class = "notes">

Hello and welcome! In this Presentation, I will be going through some different
ways of cleaning this dataset that I got off of Kaggle, called 
Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes_20231106.csv. Then, I will use the cleaned data set
to create some visualizations.

I chose to clean and visualize this data set for my project because I think it 
is important to understand why and how data gets turned from an input to an 
output. Not only does it inspire me to make the cleaned data more efficient to 
use. But, it also makes me think about how the data was collected and how I 
would collect the data differently for my own research.

Overall, I think that the ability to clean data is an important skill that
involved many different types of data.

## A Brief Reminder

Do NOT edit the original data set, create a data frame to work with and edit 
that.

## Getting the Data into R


```{r dataframe}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "../")
austin_intake_raw <- read.csv("../csv/Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes_20231106.csv")

austin_intake <- austin_intake_raw
```

1. Export the "Intakes" file from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaronschlegel/austin-animal-center-shelter-intakes-and-outcomes). If the link doesn't work it is written out: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaronschlegel/austin-animal-center-shelter-intakes-and-outcomes
2. Put the file into a folder named csv, then put that folder into a folder for this project
3. Make sure your Rmd file is in a folder *next to* the csv file
4. This allows the code to work for your laptop the same way it does for mine

<div class = "notes">

Download/export the csv file from the website linked in the wiki:
and put it into a folder named csv. Make sure that your RMarkdown file is 
saved in a folder next to it, preferably with both in a folder named 
"Austin Data Tutorial" or something similar. The .. raises you out of the folder 
your R Markdown folder is in, and the /csv takes you to the csv folder next to 
it that contains the .csv file.

Please note that this is a continuously updated data set. 

If you would like your results to match mine exactly, you must get rid of all 
values from before 11/06/2023. We will be able to do this once we convert 
DateTime from a character into a date.
</div>

## Quick Note

- This is a _continuously updated data set_
- My data is from 11/06/2023, but what you download will be from the current date

## Looking at the Data

Here is the code for the following figure: 

```{r tablecode, echo = TRUE, results='hide'}
austin_intake %>% 
  head(30) %>% 
  datatable(rownames = FALSE, 
            width = "80%", 
            height = "90%", 
            options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX = "600px", scrollY = "565px"), 
            fillContainer = TRUE) %>% 
  formatStyle(columns = 1:12, fontSize = '70%')
```

<div class = "notes">

Do NOT edit the original data set, create a data frame to work with and edit 
that. If you edit the original data set, you could mess with the data in a way
that creates inaccurate representation of the truth when you try to use the data
to visualize or analyze a phenomenon or relationship.

If you would like to save your edited data into a new csv or other type of file,
please rename it something other than the original file name and put it in an 
appropriate location with an appropriate name. This way you do not overwrite
your original data and you set yourself up for success in the way you have 
organized your project.

</div>

## Figure

```{r tableshow, echo=FALSE}
austin_intake %>% 
  head(30) %>% 
  datatable(rownames = FALSE, 
            width = "80%", 
            height = "90%", 
            options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX = "600px", scrollY = "565px"), 
            fillContainer = TRUE) %>% 
  formatStyle(columns = 1:12, fontSize = '70%')
```

## Cleaning Messy Dates with Lubridate
Examples of lubridate functions:

- `mdy_hms` turns a character string into date format, you can also do `ms` or `dm`
- `date()` turns a date into y/m/d format
  - Extra information like time of day gets snipped off
- `hour()` extracts the hour from a date 
- etc.

<div class = "notes">

I am mutating to create new rows instead of overwriting the old row because I 
want to be able to keep all the tidy and untidy data where I can see them until 
the very end, so that I can visually compare them next to each other to ensure 
that I am not doing anything weird to the data when I clean it. This is just
my personal preference.

These are how you use a couple of the lubridate functions. I am using them to 
change a character column into a date column. The `mdy_hms()` function can also
be written `ymd_hms` or `dmy_hms`, it is depending on your user input to tell
it the intended order of the date format. For instance, the date 1/2/2003 could
be either January 2nd or February 1st. If you code `md` it will change the first 
values down the row to be the month. So in this case, it would be January 2nd. 

</div>

```{r datescode, echo = TRUE, results='hide'}
lubridated_alldates <- austin_intake %>% 
  mutate(datetime = mdy_hms(DateTime),
         date = date(datetime),
         hour = hour(datetime),
         month = month(datetime),
         day = day(datetime),
         year = year(datetime))
```
## Results of Lubridate

                           scrollX = "600px", 
                           scrollY = "565px"),
            caption = "Lubridated Variables: In date Format") %>% 
  formatStyle(columns = 1:4, 
              fontSize = '70%', 
              backgroundColor = styleRow(c(1,3,5,7,9), "#7fcdbb"))
```
</div>

## Using the Lubridated Data to Make Your Data Match Mine

Here we make sure that any date before November 7th, 2023 is included. This 
ensures that your results will be the same as mine when you run the R script,
even if the data set that you download is from a date past November 6th, 2023.

```{r samedateasoriginal}
lubridated <- lubridated_alldates %>% 
  filter(date < "2023-11-07")
```

## Cleaning Messy Datasets with Stringr: Rationale

```{r sexuponintakeunique}
unique(lubridated$Sex.upon.Intake)
```


- Breaking down: `as.character(str_extract_all(Sex.upon.Intake, "(.*) "))`
- `Sex.upon.Intake` is a column where "NULL", "Unknown", "neutered male", 
"spayed female", "intact male", and "intact female" are the types of observations
- Someone might want to create a visualization or analyze something about solely 
gender or whether an animal is spayed or neutered

<div class = "notes">

We looked at dates, but there are many types of variables in this data set. What
about the messy character columns? Well, here we are going to divide 
`Sex.upon.Intake` into two columns. You could also use separate(). However, this
worked and I want to learn stringr.

</div>

## Cleaning Messy Datasets with Stringr: Method

- Inputs of `str_extract_all()`: `lubridated`, `Sex.upon.Intake`, and `"(* ) "`
- `"(* ) "` is the pattern that we are searching `Sex.upon.Intake` for, if R 
checks an observation and sees a string of characters of any length (`(.*)`) 
followed be a space `" "`, it will take that character and space and put them 
into a new column labeled `intake_neuter_spay_status`
- `str_trim()` removes white space at the end of a string of characters

```{r strings}
stringed <- lubridated %>% 
  mutate(Sex.upon.Intake = na_if(Sex.upon.Intake, "Unknown"),
         intake_neuter_spay_status = 
           str_trim(as.character(str_extract_all(Sex.upon.Intake, "(.*) "))),
         intake_sex = 
           str_trim(as.character(str_extract_all(Sex.upon.Intake, " (.*)")))) 
```

<div class = "notes">
`lubridated` is the original data frame that contextualizes `Sex.upon.Intake` 
when it is put inside `str_extract_all()`, so that R can find `Sex.upon.Intake`

`str_extract_all()` takes a pattern and a string.

`str_trim()` gets rid of the space used to identify whether the string extracted
was to be the first part of the Sex.upon.Intake observation. For example, "spayed."
Or, the second part. For example, "female."

</div>

## Demo

```{r stringfigurecode, echo = TRUE, results='hide'}
stringed %>% 
  select(intake_neuter_spay_status, intake_sex, Sex.upon.Intake) %>% 
  head(10) 
```

```{r stringshow, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
stringed %>% 
  select(intake_neuter_spay_status, intake_sex, Sex.upon.Intake) %>% 
  datatable(rownames = FALSE, 
            width = "100%", 
            height = "90%", 
            options = list(pageLength = 5, 
                           scrollX = "600px", 
                           scrollY = "565px"),
            caption = "Variables Cleaned with Stringr: In Tidy Columns") %>% 
  formatStyle(columns = 1:3, 
              fontSize = '70%', 
              backgroundColor = styleRow(c(1,3,5,7,9), "lightblue"))
```


## Let's Use Another Command to Tidy Jumbled Column Values

How to Use: `str_detect()` 

1. `str_detect` & `str_extract_all` both take a string and a pattern
2. `str_detect` returns TRUE or FALSE
3. So, if TRUE, extract the number and put it under the number_age_year column.
If the number seems to be unknown, put 999. If they were days old, put them down
as zero (a baby).

<div class = "notes">

`str_detect`, like `str_extract_all` takes a string and a pattern. Instead of 
the output being the parts of the string that match the pattern, however, `str_detect`'s
output is a logical (TRUE or FALSE). This fits perfectly into `case_when()`, which
takes a logical TRUE or FALSE expression and returns one thing for TRUE and .default
for FALSE.

</div>

## Tidying the Code for Age

```{r numberagetidy}
case_whend <- stringed %>% 
  mutate(number_age_year = case_when(str_detect(Age.upon.Intake, "(.*) years") ~ 
                                       as.numeric(str_extract_all(Age.upon.Intake, 
                                                                  "(.*) ")),
                                     str_detect(Age.upon.Intake, "(.*) year") ~ 
                                       as.numeric(str_extract_all(Age.upon.Intake, 
                                                                  "(.*) ")),
                                     str_detect(Age.upon.Intake, "(.*) months") ~ 
                                       as.numeric(str_extract_all(Age.upon.Intake, 
                                                                  "(.*) "))/12,
                                     str_detect(Age.upon.Intake, "(.*) month") ~ 
                                       as.numeric(str_extract_all(Age.upon.Intake, 
                                                                  "(.*) "))/12,
                                     str_detect(Age.upon.Intake, "(.*) weeks") ~ 
                                       as.numeric(str_extract_all(Age.upon.Intake, 
                                                                  "(.*) "))/(12*4),
                                     str_detect(Age.upon.Intake, "(.*) week") ~ 
                                       as.numeric(str_extract_all(Age.upon.Intake, 
                                                                  "(.*) "))/(12*4),
                                     str_detect(Age.upon.Intake, "(.*) days") ~ 
                                       as.numeric(0),
                                     str_detect(Age.upon.Intake, "(.*) day") ~ 
                                       as.numeric(0),
                                     .default = 999)) 

```

## Tidying the Code for Age Continued

```{r numberagetidycontninued}
case_whend <- case_whend %>% 
  mutate(number_age_year = case_when(number_age_year >= 0 ~ number_age_year,
                                     number_age_year < 0 ~ 999,
                                     .default = number_age_year))
```

## Demo

```{r numberagetidyfigurecode, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
case_whend %>% 
  select(number_age_year, Age.upon.Intake) %>% 
  head(20) 
```

```{r numberagetidyfigureshow, echo=FALSE}
case_whend %>% 
  select(number_age_year, Age.upon.Intake) %>% 
  head(15) %>% 
  datatable(rownames = FALSE, 
            width = "100%", 
            height = "90%", 
            options = list(pageLength = 10, 
                           scrollX = "600px", 
                           scrollY = "565px"),
            caption = "Variables Cleaned with Stringr: In Tidy Columns") %>% 
  formatStyle(columns = 1:3, 
              fontSize = '70%', 
              backgroundColor = styleRow(c(1,3,5,7,9, 11, 13), "lightgreen"))

```

## Cursory Look at Tidying Breed
 
```{r gettingridofslashesbreed}
no_slashes_breed <- case_whend %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(col = Breed, 
                       delim = "/", 
                       names = c("breed_left", "breed_middle", "breed_right"), 
                       too_few = "align_start",
                       cols_remove = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(breed_mix = case_when(str_detect(Breed, "(.*) Mix") ~ 
                                 "Mix",
                                .default = NA)) %>% 
  mutate(breed_left = str_remove(breed_left, "Mix"))

```

## Now With Color

```{r gettingridofslashescolor}

no_slashes_all_colors <- no_slashes_breed %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(col = Color, 
                       delim = "/", 
                       names = c("color_left", "color_middle", "color_right"), 
                       too_few = "align_start",
                       cols_remove = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(color_left = case_when(Color == "Tricolor" ~
                     "Random",
                     .default = color_left),
         color_middle = case_when(Color == "Tricolor" ~
                     "Random",
                     .default = color_middle),
         color_right = case_when(Color == "Tricolor" ~
                     "Random",
                     .default = color_right))

```

## Some Visualizations Now That We Have Tidy Data

```{r ggplotcode, echo=TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
no_slashes_all_colors %>% 
  count(breed_mix) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(breed_mix, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = 
         "Ratio of Mixed Animals to Not Mixed Animals", 
       x = "Are They a Mix?", y = "Number")
```
## Figure for Mixed Dogs Compared to Not Mixed Dogs

```{r ggplotshow, echo=FALSE}
no_slashes_all_colors %>% 
  filter(Animal.Type == "Dog") %>% 
  count(breed_mix) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(breed_mix, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = 
         "Mixed Dogs Compared to Not Mixed Dogs", 
       x = "Are They a Mix?", y = "Number")
```

## More Specific: Age Distribution of Female Dog Intakes in 2020

```{r ggplotspecificcode, echo=TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
no_slashes_all_colors %>% 
  filter(Animal.Type == "Dog", year == 2020, intake_sex == "Female") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(number_age_year)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = 
         "Age Distribution of Female Dog Intakes in 2020", 
       x = "Age", y = "Number of Female Dog Intakes in 2020")
```

## Figure for Age Distribution of Female Dog Intakes in 2020

```{r ggplotspecificshow, echo=FALSE}
no_slashes_all_colors %>% 
  filter(Animal.Type == "Dog", year == 2020, intake_sex == "Female") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(number_age_year)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = 
         "Age Distribution of Female Dog Intakes in 2020", 
       x = "Age", y = "Number of Female Dog Intakes in 2020")
